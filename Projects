In my academic journey, I have worked on several projects that have strengthened my programming skills.
One of my key projects is the Dynamic Quiz Generator, a C++ program that allows users to create and attempt quizzes dynamically, featuring file handling, randomized question order, and a scoring system.
Another project, Beyond the Surface, is focused on empathy and understanding human emotions. It explores how people perceive situations differently, encouraging deep thinking and emotional awareness.

These projects have helped me develop both technical and soft skills, and I am eager to take on more meaningful projects in the future.
